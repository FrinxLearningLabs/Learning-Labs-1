# Step 4: UniConfig API call to create loopback interface 

The following requests show you how to create and in the next step, configure a loopback interface.

In the left column of the **Postman** environment, select the "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find "create loopback" PUT request.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

```
{% raw %}
PUT
http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/{{node_id}}/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-interfaces:interfaces/interface/Loopback1
{% endraw %}
```
The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{
    "frinx-openconfig-interfaces:interface": [
        {
            "name": "Loopback1",
            "config": {
                "type": "iana-if-type:softwareLoopback",
                "enabled": true,
                "name": "Loopback1"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To enable the loopback interface make sure you set "enabled" to "true".

Expected status code: **201 Created**

# Commit 

In the previous step we updated the configuration data store in FRINX ODL. In the following step we will apply those changes to the network devices. 

In the left column of **Postman** environment, select the "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find "commit" POST request.

The following request shows you how to commit your changes.

```
{% raw %}
POST
http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:commit
{% endraw %}
```

The body of the request should look as follows:

```
{
	"input": {
		"target-nodes": {
		}
	}
}
```

The response from ODL should show you the following output if all changes have been applied successfully.

```
{
    "output": {
        "overall-configuration-status": "complete",
        "node-config-results": {
            "node-config-result": [
                {
                    "nodeId": "xe",
                    "configuration-status": "complete"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

```

Expected status code: **Status 200 OK**

Both "overall-configuration-status" and "configuration-status" should show the value "complete". If not, changes have not been committed properly.
